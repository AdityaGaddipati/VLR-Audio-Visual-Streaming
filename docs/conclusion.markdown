In this course project, we take the first step on streaming audio visual speech recognition which can pave way to multiple interaction related tasks using a block-wise streaming Conformer based on contextual block processing and block-wise synchronous beam search. We also propose a technique to combine pre-trained vision and speech models by matching their frame-rates via an alignment aware upsampling technique for the visual features so that they are fused along the time axis. This fusion along time axis allows to extend techniques that work for unimodal speech recognition to multimodal audio-visual speech recognition.
